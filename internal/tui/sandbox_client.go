// Sandbox capability, filed per destination.
//
// The question is about the DAEMON's machine: the container runs where the
// daemon runs, and the client may be a laptop attached to a remote host. One
// shared answer would be the 2026-09-03 bug again, where a single plugin
// registry served every destination and the last host to reply spoke for all
// of them.
//
// It deliberately does NOT copy applyPluginList's two extra rules, and both
// departures matter:
//
//   - That function REFUSES a local answer, because the client re-detects
//     plugin availability itself at every launch and the daemon's frozen
//     answer would be staler. Here the daemon's answer is the ONLY one that
//     exists — the client cannot see the daemon's Docker engine — and the
//     local daemon is the case the whole feature targets.
//   - pluginAvailableFor falls back to LOCAL DETECTION for a destination that
//     has not answered, because a wrong offer fails loudly at spawn while a
//     wrong grey-out hides a working tool silently. There is no local
//     detection to fall back to here, and the failure mode is inverted: a
//     wrong offer means a pane that dies with a docker error. Silence is
//     therefore treated as unavailable.

// sandboxCapMsg carries a daemon's answer back into Update.

// requestSandboxCap asks one destination whether it can host a sandbox pane.

// Sent at attach and again when the create dialog opens: Docker Desktop is
// frequently not running at login and started later, so an answer cached from
// startup is the wrong one for most of a daemon's life. The daemon caches its
// side, so asking twice costs one probe.
